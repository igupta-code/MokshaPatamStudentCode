| Sept 3 | 10:45-11:15pm |                                                                                                                                                                       I went through a couple games of S/L myself and thought about how I would solve them the fastest |
|        |               |                                                                                                                             You want the longest ladders possible w/o any snakes. So, first find the longest ladder in the board. What's the fastest way to get there? |
|        |               |                                                                                                                                                                    Is there another ladder? If not, roll the greatest number you can(6) unless there is a snake there. |
| Sept 3 | 11:15-11:45pm |                                                            I layed out some code using recurssion centered around finding the longest ladder. Base cases: if your finished -- return. Or, if there are no ladders, add the largest number you can w/o hitting a snake. | 
|        |               | Then you recurse, passing in the starting position of the longest ladder as the end of the board. If the start = the end position but you haven't reached the end of the puzzle, then reset the start to be the end of the ladder and the end to the end of the board. |
| Sept 5 |   8:30-9pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                            Read and tried to understand the packet about Graph theory. |
| Sept 6 |   1:30-2pm    |                                                                                                                                                       Started on code: initialized valiables to keep track of the Queue, snakes/ladders, if each spot is visited, etc. |
| Sept 7 |   8:45-9:15   |                                                                                                                                                                                              Used the debugger to fixe the way I init my snakes/ladders into my array. |
| Sept 7 |   1:30-2pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                             Wrote a first draft of code based on the pseudocode from the class slides. |
| Sept 7 |   2-2:30pm    |                                                                        Realized I wasn't updating my numSteps array correctly. I was overcounting my steps, so I added a if statment that only modified the counter if the new number was less than the old #of steps. |
| Sept 7 |   3:15-3:45   |                                                                           Some test cases weren't working, so I realized I needed to check for the unwinnable board. Looked into txt file to see why board was unwinable. Added an if to check if the queue was empty. |
